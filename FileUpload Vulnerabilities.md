# File upload vulnerabilities
 
File upload vulnerabilities refer to security issues associated with the functionality that allows users to upload files to a web application. While file uploads are a common feature in many web applications, they can become a significant security risk if not implemented and configured properly. Attackers may exploit these vulnerabilities to perform various high-severity attacks, including the upload of malicious files such as web shells, which can lead to unauthorized control of a web server.

Here's an explanation of the key concepts related to file upload vulnerabilities:
1. File Upload Functionality:
- Web applications often include features that allow users to upload files, such as images, documents, or other types of content.
- File upload functionality typically involves the submission of files through a form on a web page.
2. Security Implications:
- If file upload functionality is not properly secured, attackers may exploit vulnerabilities to upload malicious files to the server.
- Malicious files can include web shells, which are scripts that provide unauthorized access and control over the server.
3. Bypassing Common Defense Mechanisms:
- Web developers often implement security measures to prevent malicious file uploads, such as file type validation, size restrictions, and content inspection.
- Attackers attempt to bypass these defense mechanisms by employing various techniques, including changing file extensions, using double extensions, or manipulating file content.
4. Web Shell Upload:
- One specific goal of attackers is to upload a web shell, which is a script that provides a command-line interface or web-based interface for interacting with the server.
- Once a web shell is uploaded and executed, attackers can gain unauthorized control over the server, leading to various malicious activities.
5. Testing for File Upload Vulnerabilities:
- Security professionals and ethical hackers conduct testing to identify and mitigate file upload vulnerabilities.
- This testing involves attempting to upload files with malicious content, testing for bypass techniques, and ensuring that security mechanisms effectively prevent unauthorized uploads.
6. Mitigation Strategies:
- Developers should implement robust security measures to mitigate file upload vulnerabilities, including:
    - Validating file types based on file signatures and not relying solely on file extensions.
    - Enforcing proper file size restrictions.
    - Implementing anti-virus scanning to detect malicious content.
    - Securing file upload directories to prevent unauthorized access.


# What are file upload vulnerabilities?

File upload vulnerabilities occur when a web server allows users to upload files to its filesystem without implementing sufficient security measures to validate the uploaded files. Failing to enforce restrictions on various aspects of the uploaded files, such as their name, type, contents, or size, can lead to severe security risks. Even seemingly harmless features like image upload functionality can become a powerful vector for attacks if not properly secured.

Here's a more detailed explanation of file upload vulnerabilities:

1. Insufficient Validation:
- File upload vulnerabilities arise when the web server fails to properly validate the attributes of the uploaded files. This includes aspects such as the file's name, type, content, and size.
- Without proper validation, an attacker can exploit the upload functionality to upload arbitrary and potentially dangerous files to the server.
2. Potential Exploits:
- The impact of file upload vulnerabilities can be significant. Attackers may exploit this weakness to upload files that could include malicious scripts or executable code, enabling them to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
3. Server-Side Script Execution:
- In severe cases, attackers might upload server-side script files (e.g., PHP, ASP, or JSP) that, when executed, allow for remote code execution on the server.
- This could lead to complete compromise of the server, unauthorized access to sensitive data, and potentially the ability to launch further attacks against the web application or its users.
4. Damage upon Upload:
- In some scenarios, the act of uploading the file itself can cause damage. For example, uploading a file with a specially crafted name or content might trigger vulnerabilities in the server-side processing of the file.
5. Follow-Up Attacks:
- After uploading a malicious file, attackers might initiate a follow-up HTTP request to interact with or trigger the execution of the uploaded file. This could lead to the execution of malicious code or actions on the server.
6. Mitigation Strategies:
- To prevent file upload vulnerabilities, developers should implement robust security measures:
    - Validate file types based on both file extensions and content inspection.
    - Enforce strict size restrictions on uploaded files.
    - Implement anti-virus scanning to detect and block files with malicious content.
    - Store uploaded files in a secure location with restricted access.
    - Avoid executing uploaded files in a way that could introduce security risks.


# What is the impact of file upload vulnerabilities?

The impact of file upload vulnerabilities in a web application can vary based on how well the website validates different aspects of the uploaded files and the restrictions imposed on these files post-upload. Two crucial factors influencing the impact are:

1. Validation of File Attributes:
  - The website's failure to properly validate various attributes of the uploaded files, such as size, type, contents, and more, can significantly impact the severity of potential exploits.
  - Common attributes to validate include file type, size, content, and name.
2. Post-Upload Restrictions:
  - The impact is also influenced by the restrictions imposed on the uploaded files after they have been successfully uploaded. These restrictions may include access controls, execution permissions, and proper handling of the uploaded content.

## Worst Case Scenario:

1. Type Validation Failure:
  - If the website fails to validate the file type properly and the server allows the execution of certain types of files (e.g., .php, .jsp), an attacker could potentially upload a server-side code file, creating a web shell.
  - A web shell grants the attacker full control over the server, enabling them to execute arbitrary commands, manipulate data, and potentially compromise the entire system.
2. Filename Validation Failure:
  - If filename validation is inadequate, an attacker could overwrite critical files by uploading a file with the same name. This could lead to the disruption of essential functionalities or the replacement of crucial configuration files.
3. Directory Traversal Vulnerability:
  - If the server is vulnerable to directory traversal, an attacker might be able to upload files to unexpected or sensitive locations, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data manipulation.
4. Size Validation Failure:
  - Failing to enforce size restrictions on uploaded files could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. An attacker may fill up available disk space by repeatedly uploading large files, causing disruptions to normal server operations.

## Mitigation Strategies:

1. Robust Validation:
  - Validate file types based on both file extensions and content inspection.
  - Enforce strict size restrictions on uploaded files.
2. Anti-Virus Scanning:
  - Implement anti-virus scanning to detect and block files with malicious content.
3. Secure Storage and Execution:
  - Store uploaded files in secure locations with restricted access.
  - Avoid executing uploaded files in ways that introduce security risks.
4. Comprehensive Security Measures:
  - Employ a combination of security measures to prevent different aspects of file upload vulnerabilities, including proper validation, secure storage practices, and post-upload restrictions.


# How do file upload vulnerabilities arise?

File upload vulnerabilities arise due to inadequate or flawed validation mechanisms implemented by developers when allowing users to upload files to a web application. While it's uncommon for websites to have no restrictions on file uploads, more often, developers implement what they believe to be robust validation that, unfortunately, can be inherently flawed or bypassed. 

Here are common reasons for the emergence of file upload vulnerabilities:

1. Inadequate File Type Validation:
- Developers may attempt to blacklist dangerous file types, preventing users from uploading files with specific extensions associated with executable code (e.g., .php, .exe). However, flaws in parsing or incomplete blacklists can allow attackers to bypass these restrictions.
- Parsing discrepancies may arise when developers rely solely on file extensions without considering alternative formats or encoding techniques.
2. Parsing and Content Manipulation:
- Websites may attempt to determine the file type by checking properties within the file. Attackers can manipulate these properties using tools like Burp Proxy or Repeater, presenting a file as one type while its actual content is different.
- Techniques like double extensions (e.g., filename.php.jpg) or file content manipulation may be used to trick the validation process.
3. Omission of Obscure File Types:
- Blacklisting file types may inadvertently omit more obscure or less common formats that still pose security risks. Attackers can leverage these overlooked formats to upload malicious files.
4. Inconsistent Validation Across Hosts and Directories:
- Validation measures might be applied inconsistently across different hosts or directories within a website. Inconsistencies create discrepancies that attackers can exploit by targeting specific paths where validation may be less stringent.
5. Security Measure Bypass:
Developers may employ security measures that can be easily bypassed. For instance, if the server relies on client-side validation or JavaScript checks, an attacker can manipulate the client-side code or send requests directly to the server without going through the expected validation process.
6. Unintended Network Exploitation:
- Discrepancies in validation across a network of hosts forming the website can lead to unintended network exploitation. An attacker might identify a less secure host or directory where validation is lax and attempt to exploit vulnerabilities from there.

## Mitigation Strategies:

1. Comprehensive Whitelisting:
- Instead of blacklisting, use a comprehensive whitelist of allowed file types based on content inspection, MIME types, and other attributes.
2. Content Inspection:
- Implement content inspection to verify the actual content of the file rather than relying solely on file extensions.
3. Secure File Handling:
- Store uploaded files in secure locations with restricted access to prevent unauthorized access and execution.
4. Consistent Validation Across the Network:
- Ensure consistent and robust validation measures are applied uniformly across all hosts and directories forming the website.
5. Regular Security Audits:
- Conduct regular security audits and testing to identify and address potential weaknesses in file upload functionality.


# How do web servers handle requests for static files?

Web servers handle requests for static files by following a process that involves parsing the request path, identifying the file extension, determining the file type based on predefined mappings, and responding accordingly. Here's a brief explanation of the steps involved:

1. Request Parsing:
- When a user requests a static file (e.g., stylesheet, image) from a web server, the server parses the path in the request to identify the file.
2. File Extension Identification:
The server extracts the file extension from the parsed path, which helps determine the type of file being requested (e.g., .html, .css, .jpg).
3. MIME Type Mapping:
The server uses a preconfigured list of mappings between file extensions and MIME types to identify the content type of the requested file. MIME types define the nature of the content (e.g., text/html, image/jpeg).
4. Handling Non-Executable Files:
For non-executable file types (e.g., images, static HTML pages), the server simply sends the file's contents in an HTTP response to the client.
5. Handling Executable Files:
- For executable file types (e.g., PHP files), the server checks its configuration. If configured to execute files of this type, it assigns variables based on HTTP headers and parameters, runs the script, and sends the output in an HTTP response.
- If the server is not configured to execute such files, it may respond with an error. However, in some cases, the contents of the file may still be served to the client as plain text, leading to potential information disclosure.
6. Error Handling:
- Misconfigurations or security lapses may lead to errors or unintended information disclosure. For example, if an executable file is not properly configured for execution, the server might respond with an error or inadvertently expose the file's contents.


# Exploiting unrestricted file uploads to deploy a web shell

Exploiting unrestricted file uploads to deploy a web shell is a severe security risk that allows attackers to gain full control over a web server. A web shell is a malicious script that enables arbitrary command execution on the server through HTTP requests to a specific endpoint. Here's a brief explanation:

1. Web Shell Definition:
A web shell is a malicious script that, when uploaded to a vulnerable server, allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands remotely.
2. Exploiting Unrestricted File Uploads:
In the worst-case scenario, a website allows users to upload server-side scripts (e.g., PHP, Java, Python) and is configured to execute them as code.
3. Web Shell Capabilities:
- If a web shell is successfully uploaded, the attacker gains full control over the server, enabling various malicious activities.
- The attacker can read and write arbitrary files, exfiltrate sensitive data, and use the server to launch attacks against internal infrastructure or other servers.
4. Reading Arbitrary Files:
- A simple PHP script within a web shell can be used to read the contents of arbitrary files on the server's filesystem.
- Example:
    
    ```php
    <?php echo file_get_contents('/path/to/target/file'); ?>
    ```
- Sending a request for this script will return the contents of the specified file in the response.
5. Versatile Web Shell:
- A more versatile web shell allows the attacker to execute arbitrary system commands by passing them through query parameters.
- Example:
    
    ```php
    <?php echo system($_GET['command']); ?>
    ```
- An attacker can send requests with different system commands via query parameters, enabling them to perform various actions on the server.
6. Command Execution Example:
- Requesting the web shell with a specific command:
    
    ```bash
    GET /example/exploit.php?command=id HTTP/1.1
    ```
- This query executes the "id" command on the server, and the response contains the output of the executed command.


# Exploiting flawed validation of file uploads

Exploiting flawed validation of file uploads often involves manipulating the content type headers in the POST requests when submitting forms with file uploads. Websites commonly use content type headers to validate the types of files being uploaded, but flaws in this validation can be exploited to bypass security measures and potentially achieve remote code execution.

Here's a brief explanation:

1. Content Type Headers in Form Submission:
- When submitting forms with file uploads, browsers use the content type application/x-www-form-urlencoded for simple text data and multipart/form-data for binary data like images or documents.
- The multipart/form-data content type divides the message body into separate parts, each corresponding to a form input, and includes headers such as Content-Disposition and Content-Type for each part.
2. Flawed File Type Validation:
- Websites may attempt to validate file uploads by checking the Content-Type header associated with each part. For example, they might only allow specific MIME types (e.g., image/jpeg, image/png) for image uploads.
3. Implicit Trust in Content-Type Headers:
- Flaws occur when the server implicitly trusts the Content-Type headers without further validation of the actual file contents.
- If the server expects images and only validates based on the provided Content-Type header, an attacker can manipulate the headers to deceive the server about the file type being uploaded.
4. Exploitation Using Tools like Burp Repeater:
- Tools like Burp Repeater allow attackers to manipulate and resend requests to the server, enabling them to modify the content type headers during file uploads.
- By changing the Content-Type header to a trusted MIME type (e.g., image/jpeg) while uploading a different file type, the attacker can trick the server into accepting malicious content.
5. Bypassing Flawed Validation:
- The server may only check the provided Content-Type header without validating whether the file contents match the expected type.
- Attackers can use this flaw to bypass security measures by uploading files with malicious content but misleading content type headers.
6. Potential Security Implications:
- Exploiting flawed file type validation can lead to the upload of malicious files, including scripts or web shells, potentially resulting in remote code execution on the server.
- Attackers can achieve unauthorized access, data manipulation, and even pivot attacks against other servers within the network.


# Preventing file execution in user-accessible directories

To prevent the execution of scripts in user-accessible directories, servers typically rely on explicit configuration of MIME types for script execution. Even if dangerous file types slip through initial checks, the server attempts to avoid script execution by adhering to predefined MIME type configurations. If a request tries to execute a script, the server may respond with an error message or serve the file contents as plain text, preventing the creation of a web shell.

Here's a brief explanation:

1. Script Execution Configuration:
- Servers are configured to execute scripts based on their MIME types. Only scripts with allowed MIME types are executed, while others result in errors or plain text responses.
2. Example Request for Script Execution:
- An example request attempting to execute a PHP script:
    ```bash
    GET /static/exploit.php?command=id HTTP/1.1
    Host: normal-website.com
    ```

3. Server Response to Script Execution Attempt:
- The server responds with a 200 OK status but sets the Content-Type to text/plain, indicating a plain text response instead of script execution.
    ```php
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: text/plain
    Content-Length: 39

    <?php echo system($_GET['command']); ?>
    ```

4. Leaking Source Code:
- While this behavior may leak source code, it prevents the creation of a web shell by nullifying attempts to execute uploaded scripts.
5. Different Configurations for Directories:
- Configuration for script execution often varies between directories. Directories where user-supplied files are uploaded have stricter controls, while other locations assume files are not user-supplied and may have different configurations.
6. Exploiting Different Directories:
- If an attacker can find a way to upload a script to a directory not intended for user-supplied files, the server may execute the script based on that directory's configuration.
7. Reverse Proxy Consideration:
- Requests to the same domain may pass through a reverse proxy, such as a load balancer, which can handle requests differently.
- Behind-the-scenes servers handling requests may have distinct configurations, potentially leading to different outcomes for script execution.


# Insufficient blacklisting of dangerous file types

Insufficient blacklisting of dangerous file types is a common vulnerability when preventing users from uploading malicious scripts. Blacklisting file extensions (e.g., blocking .php files) is flawed, as attackers can bypass it by using alternative, lesser-known executable extensions (e.g., .php5, .shtml). Overriding server configurations and obfuscating file extensions are techniques attackers use to exploit these weaknesses.

Here's a brief explanation:

1. Blacklisting Vulnerability:  
- Blacklisting involves blocking certain file extensions (e.g., .php) to prevent the upload of potentially dangerous files.
2. Flaws in Blacklisting:  
- Blacklisting can be ineffective, as it's challenging to account for every possible file extension that may be used to execute code.
- Attackers may use alternative extensions not covered by the blacklist (e.g., .php5, .shtml) that are still executable.
3. Overriding Server Configuration:
- Servers execute files based on explicit configurations. Developers configure servers to recognize and execute specific file types (e.g., PHP) using directives in server configuration files.
4. Directory-Specific Configurations:
- Developers can create directory-specific configuration files (e.g., .htaccess for Apache, web.config for IIS) to override global settings.
- Attackers may attempt to upload malicious configuration files to manipulate server settings and enable execution of certain file types.
5. Obfuscating File Extensions:
- Obfuscation techniques aim to deceive validation mechanisms. Even if a file extension is blacklisted, attackers may use obfuscation to upload and execute malicious files.
- Techniques include providing multiple extensions (e.g., exploit.php.jpg), adding trailing characters (e.g., exploit.php.), using URL encoding (e.g., exploit%2Ephp), adding semicolons or null bytes (e.g., exploit.asp;.jpg or exploit.asp%00.jpg), and using multibyte unicode characters for conversion.
6. Defense Measures:
- Defense mechanisms may involve stripping or replacing dangerous extensions to prevent execution. However, if transformations are not applied recursively, attackers can position prohibited strings in a way that still leaves behind a valid file extension.
7. Obfuscation Examples:
- Examples of obfuscation include filenames like exploit.p.phphp or using multibyte unicode characters that may be translated and normalized in a way that introduces discrepancies.
